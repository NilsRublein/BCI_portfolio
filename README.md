# BCI_portfolio

Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI)are devices measuring changes in brain activity to control an application, primarilyfor the benefit of severely disabled people by giving them a means of communication.

As part of the BCI course at the univiersity of Twente, I wrote a scientific portfolio which included assignments, weekly summaries and presentations. The portfolio includes several BCI paradigms -- such as SSVEP, P300, N400, Imaginary movement -- signal acquisition, pre-processing techniques, classification methods and user feedback. 

Other topics amongst others include the neurophysiological properties of the brain, challenges in affective computing, neuromarketing, BCIs in art & music, multi-brain interfaces, mental state detection.
